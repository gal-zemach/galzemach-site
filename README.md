# Gal Zemach â€” Portfolio & Blog

This is my personal website, built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and based on the [Spectre](https://github.com/louisescher/spectre) template.  
It serves as a portfolio and blog, where I share technical projects and write about game development, tools engineering, and creative tech.

## Features

- Clean, dark-themed layout
- Project showcase section
- Markdown-powered blog
- Social links and About section
- Built with Astro + Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

To run the site locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:4321`.

## Deployment

Deployed via [Netlify](https://netlify.com/).

To deploy your own version:

1. Create a new site on Netlify, linking it to your GitHub repo
2. Use the following build settings:
    - Build command: `npm run build`
    - Publish directory: `dist`
3. Enable continuous deployment (optional)
