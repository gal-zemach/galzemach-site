**FileDiff** is a minimalist yet fast command-line utility that reveals the exact insertions and deletions required to turn one file into another.
Under the hood it implements Myers’ algorithm—the same strategy used by Git and GNU diff—written from scratch in C# / .NET 9.

## Highlights

- **Myers shortest-edit-script** in pure C#
- Unified, human-friendly diff output
- Self-contained binaries for **Windows (x64)** and **macOS (ARM)**
- Clean separation: algorithm · parser · printer
- Optimised `OffsetArray` for constant-time diagonal look-ups

## Quick Start

```bash
# build self-contained release (Windows example)
dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release --self-contained true

# compare two files
FileDiff file1 file2
```

## File Structure
Common/OffsetArray.cs        # diagonal-buffer helper
Diff/                        # algorithm + pretty printer
  ├─ Algorithm/MyersComparer.cs
  ├─ FileComparer.cs
  └─ Data/ (Insert | Remove | Instruction)
Program.cs                   # entry point

## Roadmap
- Side-by-side diff view
- Syntax-aware colouring
- Traceback refactor to reduce duplication
