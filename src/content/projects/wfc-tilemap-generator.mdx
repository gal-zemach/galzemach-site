A compact C++ implementation of **Wave Function Collapse (WFC)** used to create procedural tile maps with minimal hard-coding. The demo renders live in openFrameworks and visualises each collapse step.

## Features

- Edge-based adjacency rules loaded from XML
- Tile symmetries (rotations / reflections) to reduce authoring effort
- Step-by-step or full-map generation modes
- MIT-licensed *Knots* tile set by Maxim Gumin included

## Directory Glance

src/ # openFrameworks app + generator core
data/TileSets # XML + sprites

## Roadmap

- Faster neighbour lookup with pre-computed arrays
- Generic generator decoupled from rendering layer
- Minimal UI to tweak tile probabilities on the fly
