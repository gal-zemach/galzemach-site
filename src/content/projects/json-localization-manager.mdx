A lightweight desktop editor that lets you view, edit, and validate JSON localization strings without touching spreadsheets.

## Why I Built It

I wanted a first hands-on project with **Avalonia UI** and MVVM. Managing localisation files is a real-world pain point, so the app focuses on fast iteration and clear validation.

## Core Capabilities

- Load any JSON file that follows the *LocalizedStrings* schema
- Inspect keys, default text, and all language translations
- Add / remove languages or entire entries on the fly
- Save back to JSON with a single click

## Tech Stack

C# 路 .NET 6 路 Avalonia UI 路 System.Text.Json 路 MVVM

## Next Up

- Prompt on unsaved changes
- Undo / redo that covers all operations
- Inline fold-out editor instead of a dedicated side panel
