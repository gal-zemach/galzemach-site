DevNotes is a self-contained playground for cloud-native tooling. The project packages a trivial “notes” web-app into separate backend and frontend containers, deploys them to a local **kind** cluster, and automates the workflow with a Jenkins pipeline.

## Highlights

- **Docker Compose** for one-command local spins
- **Kubernetes (kind)** manifests with fixed port mapping & a PVC that survives pod restarts
- **Jenkinsfile** that builds images and deploys to the cluster
- Bootstrap script that builds, loads, and applies everything in one go

## Stack

Docker · kind · kubectl · Jenkins · Flask · Nginx

## Quick Start

```bash
# Docker-compose
docker-compose up --build

# Kubernetes
./bootstrap-kind.sh

# Jenkins (optional)
cd jenkins && docker-compose up --build -d
```

Visit http://localhost:30080 (kind) or http://localhost:8000 (compose) to try the app.
