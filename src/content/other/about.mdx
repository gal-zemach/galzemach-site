I blend technical art with software engineering to build tools that make creative work flow better. From editor extensions to pipeline automation, I love bridging design ideas and technical solutions — in Unity, Unreal, or wherever creativity meets code.

I’m always curious, always experimenting, and happiest when exploring new technologies.
