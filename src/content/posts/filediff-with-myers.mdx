## Introduction

During a technical interview, I had to write a CLI that compares two files. Rather than brute-force a solution, I used the challenge as an excuse to implement the same algorithm that powers Git diff and GNU diff: **Myers’ algorithm**.
For a tools developer, diffing sits in this sweet spot—mixing algorithmic depth with practical, day-to-day utility. Think comparing files or assets to spot configuration differences, or using Git to trace or commit changes.

## Why Implement an Algorithm

As a tools developer, I normally avoid solving problems that have been solved well before. But this felt like the right moment to make an exception.
This assignment was small, self-contained, and genuinely interesting. Building the diff myself:

- let me explore a classic algorithm in depth
- added substance to what would’ve been a basic CLI
- produced a reusable snippet I can embed in future tools

## A 60-Second Primer on Myers’ Algorithm

Myers finds the **shortest edit script**—the smallest set of inserts and deletes that turns sequence A into sequence B.

1. **Edit graph**: Each node represents a pair of positions `(i, j)` in the two sequences.
2. **Moves**
   - → (delete from A)
   - ↓ (insert from B)
   - ↘︎ (diagonal, no cost) when `A[i] == B[j]`
3. **Search**: Walk the graph breadth-first, layer by layer, until you reach the bottom-right corner.
4. **Traceback**: Follow the path backward to produce the list of edits.
5. **Complexity**: If `N = |A| + |B|` and `D = edits`, then the algorithm runs in `O(ND)` time and `O(ND²)` space.

## Implementation Highlights (C# / .NET 9)

- **CLI UX** – `diff fileA.txt fileB.txt` prints a unified diff.
- **Enum-based ops** – `Insert`, `Delete` keep the code readable.
- **Edge cases** – Handles empty files, identical files, trailing whitespace.
- **Separation of concerns** – Parsing, diffing, and printing live in separate classes for easier testing.

## What Went Well

- Clean layers made unit tests trivial.
- Myers’ taught me a lot about dynamic programming and greedy vs. optimal paths.
- Even “tiny” tools surface nasty edge cases—traceback logic was trickier than the forward search!

## What I’d Improve

As with any project, it’s important to know when to stop polishing. In this case, I prioritized cleaner logic over strict polymorphism and allowed some code duplication in the traceback to keep things straightforward.
That said, I’d love to:

- refactor the traceback logic to reduce repetition without over-complicating it
- add a side-by-side diff view for better readability
- explore syntax coloring or filetype-aware formatting to make the output easier to scan

## Conclusion

Building this tool deepened both my algorithmic thinking and my appreciation for everyday developer tooling. Even outside the interview context, this is something I could see evolving into a helpful utility for comparing asset metadata or validating generated content in a pipeline.
