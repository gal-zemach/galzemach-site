As a Unity pipeline/tools developer exploring Unreal’s build ecosystem, I wanted to understand Unreal’s build flow and how to translate concepts from Unity (like AssetBundles, CI steps, and multi-platform builds) into Unreal's model.

## General

BuildCookRun is an Unreal Automation Tool (UAT) that compiles the game’s code, cooks its content, packages it into the target platform’s native format, deploys and runs it.

Actual command stages:
- **Build**: Uses Unreal Build Tool (UBT) to compile the code (C++, both engine & game) to executables
- **Cook**: Uses UE to cook the content (uassets/umaps)
- **Stage**: Copies the executables & content to a staging directory
- **Package**: Packages the project into a platform’s native distribution format (.pak files)
- **Deploy**: Deploys the build to a target device
- **Run**: Starts the packaged project on the target platform

### Cooking in Unreal
Convert raw assets (uasset/umap) to formats supported by the target platform.
Two ways exist Cook by the Book (CBTB) & Cook on the Fly (COTF), referring to whether assets are created all at once or only when needed.
.pak files = cooked, compressed, versioned bundles (similar to Unity’s Asset Bundles)

## My Build
- What I’m building: Lyra, a UE demo project
- Build configuration: Development
- Where: Locally on my mac
- Target: MacOS

### Available Build Configurations
- Debug: Best for debugging C++ code. Has full debug info and can be attached to a debugger.
- Development: Main build during development. Can be debugged as well.
- Shipping: A production build. Standalone, fully optimized, release-ready build.

The command I use for an “everyday” development build, on my development machine.

```
cd '/Users/Shared/Epic Games/UE_5.X/Engine/Build/BatchFiles/’

./RunUAT.sh BuildCookRun \
-project={Path to my Unreal project}/{MyProject}.uproject" \
-noP4 \
-platform=Mac \
-clientconfig=Development \
-serverconfig=Development \
-cook -allmaps -build -stage -pak \
-archive \
-archivedirectory={Build Output Directory} \
-log={Log Output Directory} -verbose
```

> Running this helped me understand how modular Unreal's build flow is - **each flag corresponds to a distinct stage that can be split, repeated, or parallelized in CI systems.** This is a key difference from Unity’s monolithic `BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer`.

### Notes/Gotchas

- An important flag I didn’t use here is `-prereqs`. It adds all prerequisites into the build. Very important so we can pass the build to another non-dev machine (f.e. QA).
- In my case, UAT logs were deleted right when the build finished. This was very annoying. I needed to pipe the terminal output to another file by adding `| tee {output file path}`.

### Flag Descriptions

| `-project` | Path to your project’s .uproject file |
| --- | --- |
| `-noP4` | Skips Perforce integration |
| `-platform` | Target platform |
| `-clientconfig` | Build configuration for the client (Debug/Development/Shipping) |
| `-serverconfig`  | Build configuration for the server |
| `-cook` | Cooks the content. |
| `-allmaps` | Cooks all levels in the project |
| `-build` | Builds the source code |
| `-stage` | Stages the files. This means preparing a single folder with all the needed files (binaries, cooked content, configs) |
| `-pak` | Packages the content into .pak files (otherwise you’ll retain the original raw assets (.uasset/.umap) |
| `-prereqs` | Adds all dependencies into the packaged build. Use it if transferring the build to a non-dev machine. Mostly relevant for windows runtime (DirectX, Visual C++, etc.) |
| `-archive` | Copies the staged folder into a clean, compressed destination |
| `-archivedirectory` | Build destination path |
| `-log` | Custom path for the build logs |
| `-verbose` | Makes the logs verbose |
